<p>At the end of April I got to work with PVA on the video for their song 'Untethered'. I did the projections that were used as a backdrop for the video. These were made using <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> and then processed with <a href="https://github.com/hydra-synth/hydra/">hydra</a>. I had a midi controller hooked up so that I could make changes as they played and sync the visuals up to the song. You can see the code I used <a href="https://github.com/gabrieldavison/pva_untethered_visuals">here</a>. You'll have to make some changes to get it running though as it's expeciting to be hooked up to a midi controller and will throw an error if it's not plugged in.</p>
