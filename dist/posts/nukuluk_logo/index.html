<p>An animated logo I worked on for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nukuluk_nukuluk/?hl=en">@nukuluk_nukuluk</a>. This was projected during a live show.</p>
<p>The model was rendered using <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a> and the processed with <a href="https://github.com/hydra-synth/hydra">hydra</a>. I set up a few different processing chains and then toggled them at diffrent intervals, sometimes changing the speed of the interval itself. The chains are mostly modulation or feedback effects. If you click 'View Live&quot; above you will be taken to an instance of the code I used to generate the video where you can see the effects applied in real time.</p>
