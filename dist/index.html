<p>An animated logo I worked on for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nukuluk_nukuluk/?hl=en">@nukuluk_nukuluk</a>. This was projected during a live show.</p>
<p>The model was rendered using <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a> and the processed with <a href="https://github.com/hydra-synth/hydra">hydra</a>. I set up a few different processing chains and then toggled them at diffrent intervals, sometimes changing the speed of the interval itself. The chains are mostly modulation or feedback effects. If you click 'View Live&quot; above you will be taken to an instance of the code I used to generate the video where you can see the effects applied in real time.</p>

<p>At the end of April I got to work with PVA on the video for their song 'Untethered'. I did the projections that were used as a backdrop for the video. These were made using <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> and then processed with <a href="https://github.com/hydra-synth/hydra/">hydra</a>. I had a midi controller hooked up so that I could make changes as they played and sync the visuals up to the song. You can see the code I used <a href="https://github.com/gabrieldavison/pva_untethered_visuals">here</a>. You'll have to make some changes to get it running though as it's expeciting to be hooked up to a midi controller and will throw an error if it's not plugged in.</p>
